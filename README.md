# FantaBookApp
FantaBook is an application that was created to create a network for those
who play FantaCalcio and to keep track of players’ stats. Users can add all of
their squads and browse through the squads of other owners. The application
provides broad information about each player; it maintains and allows users
to search for them using particular filters to narrow the scope of their search.
Users can then use a ”like” system to convey their feelings about players and
eventually add them to their favorites. They can also follow other users to get
recommendations for players and squads they might enjoy.
